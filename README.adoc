:source-highlighter: coderay


== The environment

This Docker image provides:

* Ubuntu latest
* jq
* curl
* OpenSSL



== How to use it

Just run:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -it -v <your directory>:/keyfiles/ tkmtwo/json2p12
----

Docker maps your directory with [path]_/keyfiles_ directory in the container.

After you start the container, you can use `json2p12` to convert.


* To run json2p12 on an input JSON file:
+
[source,bash]
----
json2p12 mykey.json mynewpassphrase
----

Three new files will be created:
[source,text]
----

mykey.cert
mykey.key
mykey-new.key
mykey.p12

----


Where `mykey.p12` is the resulting private key and certificate for use
in tools that do not use the JSON version.

Both the p12 container and private key have passphrases changed.
